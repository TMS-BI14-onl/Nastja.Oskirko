Why do we need a subquery?
Correct answer:
SELECT man.first_name, man.cast_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) as cnt_of_emp
FROM employees man, employees emp ON man.employee_id=emp.manager_id
GROUP BY man.first_name, man.cast_name
HAVING COUNT(emp.employee_id)>6

Is it a joke? :|
Once again, subquery. And here not 1, but even two.
Correct answer:
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES region_name
FROM Employees e JOIN Departments d ON dep.department_id=emp.department_id
	JOIN Locations l ON d.location_id=l.location_id
	JOIN Countries c ON l.country_id=c.country_id
	JOIN Regions r ON c.region_id=r.region_id 
GROUP BY region_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC

Only there subquery is needed.
I guess, now we have a problem with addding everywhere not window functions, but subqueries :)
